Known the world over as “The Steel City”, Sheffield was famed for its industry in the heyday of the 1900’s and remains a city of innovation to this day. However the smoking chimney stacks are no more and instead you’ll find a green, modern cityscape set against the stunning backdrop of the Peak District National Park.

Sheffield has a friendly, independent and alternative spirit that you won’t find in other cities, alongside a thriving cultural scene boasting award-winning theatre, beer, music, festivals, street art and so much more.

The city has a long sporting heritage, and is home to the world's oldest football club, Sheffield F.C.<sup id="cite_ref-celebration_6-0" class="reference"></sup> Games between the two professional clubs, Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday, are known as the Steel City derby.Sheffield has two universities, the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University. The two combined bring about 60,000 students to the city every year. Sheffield University was established in 1897 as University College Sheffield and became the University of Sheffield in 1905.
