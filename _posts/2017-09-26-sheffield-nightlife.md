Sheffield is full of places to go out but the hard part is deciding where to go. some of the popular nightclubs which students attend are Amnesia, Corporation, Code, Crystal, Plug and Leadmill. If nightclubs are not your type of atmosphere there are also many bars in Sheffield such as Bar One, Bungalows and Bears, Devonshire Cat ans Soyo.
